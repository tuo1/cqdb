id="abstract">Abstract<a href="#abstract" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Abstract" title="Direct link to Abstract">​</a></h3><p>As the pace of informatization construction and application accelerates, data volumes are growing rapidly, the number and types of databases continue to increase, and database environments are becoming increasingly complex. Databases are at the core of data storage and processing, and massive amounts of data are constantly flowing through database systems. If there are security vulnerabilities within, it will directly impact the normal operation of core business and may even jeopardize social stability.</p><p>Based on statistics from recent years on database security incidents, the biggest threat to database security comes from internal sources. Malicious insiders and human errors pose the greatest threat to database security, rather than external intruders. Internally, controlling and monitoring database access and operations are crucial for data security to prevent data leakage, data corruption, and database unavailability resulting from internal factors, which are often overlooked.</p><p>Innovatively, CloudQuery proposes a solution for &quot;managing database uniformly and safely,using batabase efficiently&quot; ,addressing various aspects of efficient and secure data usage. This ensures data security, prevents leakage of critical data and personal information, and provides assurance for promoting high-quality development in science and technology informatization efforts.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="1-status-of-data-security">1. Status of Data Security<a href="#1-status-of-data-security" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 1. Status of Data Security" title="Direct link to 1. Status of Data Security">​</a></h3><p>CloudQuery has continuously conducted research and identified the following risks in the current enterprise database management model:</p><p><strong>Account Security Risks:</strong></p><ul><li>Unauthorized database accounts may exist.</li><li>Database accounts of employees who have left the company, resigned, etc., might not be promptly removed.</li><li>Long-term unused database accounts might be present.</li><li>Weak passwords or infrequent password changes for database administrators and accounts with sensitive permissions.</li><li>Database accounts are shared by multiple operators, making it difficult to trace specific actions to individuals.</li><li>Database account passwords are stored in plain text.</li></ul><p><strong>Permission Control Risks:</strong></p><ul><li>Users or departments may have database permissions beyond their job responsibilities, resulting in a risk of unauthorized use.</li></ul><p><strong>Data Leakage Risks:</strong></p><ul><li>Lack of permission control for data querying and exporting, allowing copying and exporting of data for those with database permissions.</li><li>Insufficient measures to prevent data leakage through screen capture or photography.</li><li>Sensitive data such as personal information, business records, and technical information not appropriately masked and displayed in plain text.</li></ul><p><strong>Risk of Operational Staff Tampering and Database Overuse:</strong></p><p>Operational staff may use database accounts for management with permissions exceeding what is necessary for actual operational management.Without appropriate access behavior control, motivated by personal gain, operational staff could directly manipulate transactions and steal sensitive data.</p><p><strong>Insufficient Audit Trails and Difficulty in Tracing:</strong></p><p>Monitoring data access throughout the organization is a critical means of tracing and gathering evidence.Inadequate alerting for abnormal data operations and failure to collect detailed audit information on database activities can make tracing difficult, resulting in unclear accountability and potential for recurring security breaches.</p><p><strong>Risk of Accidental Data Deletion:</strong></p><p>Core business databases are vital for stable business operations, with wide-ranging impacts.Without secure control mechanisms for data deletion or modification operations on core business databases, accidental or malicious operations could lead to irreparable consequences.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="2-approach-to-problem-resolution">2. Approach to Problem Resolution<a href="#2-approach-to-problem-resolution" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 2. Approach to Problem Resolution" title="Direct link to 2. Approach to Problem Resolution">​</a></h3><p>Establish a unified database security management platform. This includes a unified database access entry, unified database user identity authentication, unified database permission control, unified database monitoring and auditing, as well as capabilities for data masking, SQL review and deployment, data backup and rollback, and alerting and interception of high-risk operations. This system aims to prevent unauthorized data access, data leaks, accidental data deletion, etc., ensuring the smooth and efficient operation of the database. The primary objectives are as follows:</p><p><strong>Unified Database Access Entry:</strong></p><p>By providing a unified platform for database development and management, we aim to centralize the database access entry and management entry, while implementing unified and secure control over individual data access behaviors.</p><p><strong>Fine-grained permission control：</strong></p><p>This involves precise control over database access behaviors, such as controlling the operation object, operation type, operation time, and terminal window before access, and managing high-risk operations and sensitive data protection during access. It also includes controlling resultset operations and export functions after access. This helps prevent the misuse of high-privileged accounts, limit unauthorized operations, and mitigate high-risk actions.</p><p><strong>Prevention of Data Leakage:</strong></p><p>Restrict users to access data within their own permissions, following the principle of &quot;separation of querying and exporting&quot; where querying and exporting permissions are granted separately. This prevents internal data leaks, database dragging, and table dragging. Additionally, features like data copy switch and data watermarking are included to prevent sensitive data from being copied or leaked through screenshots or photographs.</p><p><strong>Protection of Sensitive Data:</strong></p><p>Desensitize sensitive data such as personal information, business records, and technical information before display, adding an extra layer of security. This protects privacy and confidential data without affecting normal data access.</p><p><strong>Prevention of Accidental Data Deletion:</strong></p><p>Implementing closed-loop management for data change processes. Prior to data changes, providing risk alerts, SQL reviews, manual reviews, data backup, and other operations. If users delete data accidentally,the platform provides data recovery function. Comprehensive control is exercised over data change before, during, and after, to prevent accidental data deletion.</p><p><strong>Enhancement of Development Efficiency:</strong></p><ul><li>Unified database operating interface for centralized management of various database types. No need to switch between multiple database management tools frequently, enabling unified operations across different types of databases without the need to purchase multiple database client licenses, thus saving usage and learning costs.</li><li>Conduct pre-deployment review of SQL to prevent potentially risky SQL from going live.</li><li>Different departments can engage in online process handling, eliminating the need for users to engage in inefficient offline communication.</li></ul><p><strong>Security Audit:</strong></p><p>Conduct a comprehensive and precise analysis and recording of data operations, analyzing data operation behaviors at three levels: overview, user, and database object.</p><ul><li>Display the volume of operations in a graphical interface, making database operation behaviors clear at a glance.</li><li>Aggregate user behaviors and permissions at the user level, tracking specific user behaviors in real-time.</li><li>Aggregate the specific actions performed on individual database objects at the database object level, and track the actions on database objects in real-time.</li></ul><p>This enables traceable and queryable data operation trails.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="3-produt-introduction">3.

CloudQuery Provides a unified platform for database development and operations, achieves a unified database access entry and management entry. Enterprises can achieve unified and secure control over data access behaviors.This includes: unified database access entry, unified database user identity authentication, unified database permission control, and unified database monitoring and auditing.</p><p>CloudQuery can centrally manage enterprise databases within the platform by means of account retrieval, restricting access IPs, and limit<br>
<!-- -->ing access tools, thereby consolidating other database access entries.The platform serves as a unified access entry for databases, providing users with a convenient and fast data querying method based on B/S architecture SQL interaction. Users can access all databases through a single web page. CloudQuery can enhance data operation efficiency while shielding the differences between various databases, saving users time and learning costs associated with switching between different database management tools.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="52-data-operation">5.2 Data Operation<a href="#52-data-operation" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 5.2 Data Operation" title="Direct link to 5.2 Data Operation">​</a></h4><p>As a cloud-oriented database security and control platform, the cloud database client is the core module of the platform. Its significance is akin to the kernel of an operating system, upon which all other platform functionalities are built and extended.It has the following core functionalities:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Advanced SQL Editor:</strong> An advanced SQL editor that spans multiple types of database. The editor supports SQL 2011 standards and database-specific syntax. It allows for quick switching between different databases, eliminating the need for repetitive switching between various clients. It features code highlighting, auto-completion, SQL formatting, execution plans, favorites, shortcuts, graphical interface, and other rapid coding assistive tools.</p></li><li><p><strong>Database Object Management:</strong> The platform supports the creation and editing of over ten types of database objects, including databases, tables, functions, stored procedures, DBLINK, packages, package bodies, sequences, triggers, and more.</p></li><li><p><strong>Data Import and Export:</strong> The platform supports data import from files such as EXCEL, CSV, TXT, etc., with customizable delimiters. It also supports the export of database structure, table structure, and table data.</p></li><li><p><strong>Graphical Visualization:</strong> Supports a graphical interface for creating tables, indexes, and triggers. It also enables changes to table structures and CRUD operations on table data through a graphical interface. The operation is consistent with traditional clients, making it easy to use.</p></li><li><p><strong>Database Terminal Management:</strong> Supports database terminal connections. When the editor cannot meet the requirements, database-related operations can be performed using the terminal connection method, covering all database commands.</p></li><li><p><strong>Resultset Management:</strong> Resultset data is displayed in a paginated form, and you can set the number of rows per page to improve query efficiency and reduce server load. The platform supports resultset viewing, editing, copying, and downloading. It also supports single-row data viewing mode, binary field display, and execution log display, showing execution time, results, executed SQL, errors, and other information.</p></li><li><p><strong>Data Dictionary Search:</strong> It supports searching the database elements through a data dictionary. For example, searching by &quot;data element name,&quot; &quot;data element name keywords,&quot; &quot;data element name list,&quot; etc., to accurately, quickly, and in batches filter out data elements. It should support filtering for &quot;hundreds of thousands&quot; of database elements and be able to filter multiple data elements in one batch.</p></li></ul><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="53-privilege-escalation-process">5.3 Privilege Escalation Process<a href="#53-privilege-escalation-process" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 5.3 Privilege Escalation Process" title="Direct link to 5.3 Privilege Escalation Process">​</a></h4><p>Users can apply for permissions to administrators through the platform&#x27;s privilege escalation process, enabling privilege escalation. The privilege escalation process meets the internal system approval process needs of the customer, and supports customizable approval processes. It allows for adjustment of approval nodes, enables setting multiple approvers for a single node for user selection, and supports adjustments based on approver types. Users can choose the duration of the permissions during the application process, and the permissions are automatically revoked upon expiration. Specific types of permission requests include:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Access Request:</strong> Users can request database access through an access request. The access request supports resource search, allowing the addition of different types of resources and selection of varying permission levels (database operation sets) for a single access request. Users can also choose the effective time for the permission level. After initiating the request, users can withdraw it. Upon completion of an access request, users can reapply.</p></li><li><p><strong>Operation Privilege Escalation:</strong> When users need to access specific database objects (tables, views, functions, etc.), they can directly initiate an operation privilege escalation on the data operation SDT tree object for unauthorized operations (DML, DQL, DML). A single operation privilege escalation supports adding different types of database objects and selecting the effective time. Users can initiate, withdraw, reapply, or make new applications after initiating an operation privilege escalation.</p></li><li><p><strong>High-Risk Operation Permission Request:</strong> When users need high-risk operation permissions, they can apply through a high-risk operation application. Users can selectively initiate a high-risk operation application based on the high-risk levels defined by the administrator when encountering high-risk operations. They can choose the effective time for the high-risk operation. After initiating the high-risk operation application, users can withdraw and reapply it.</p></li><li><p><strong>Tool-use Permission Request:</strong> Users can request terminal window access, synchronous data dictionary access, resultset operations, and resultset export through a tool permission request. Users are prompted to apply when they lack permissions. After initiating the request, users can withdraw it and reapply.</p></li><li><p><strong>Data Change Request:</strong> When users need to make data changes, they can apply through data correction or change publication workflows. The data-change workflow supports bulk script entry or upload, SQL checking, and rollback statement entry. The rollback statement is used for rollback operations in case of script execution failure. Users can choose between manual and automatic script execution modes.</p></li><li><p>When users need to view sensitive data in plaintext, they can apply through the database data desensitization privilege escalation process. After a successful privilege escalation, users can view sensitive data in plaintext. During the application, users need to select the fields they wish to view in plaintext.</p></li></ul><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="54-audit-analysis">5.4 Audit analysis<a href="#54-audit-analysis" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 5.4 Audit analysis" title="Direct link to 5.4 Audit analysis">​</a></h4><p>Traditional database audit products are generally deployed on the side, analyzing mirrored switch traffic. However, they face issues such as duplicate analysis, incorrect analysis, and long statement splitting analysis for private database protocols.</p><p>This leads to millions of records of behavior every day, overwhelming operations personnel and making it impossible to extract effective operational records from the massive audit records. They are unable to rely on audit results for decision-making, rendering database audit practically useless.</p><p>CloudQuery effectively addresses the shortcomings of traditional database audit products. It can obtain executed SQL statements based on the platform&#x27;s underlying interface, resulting in audit results that are 100% accurate.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Audit Overview.</strong> Leveraging the built-in streaming analysis engine, the CloudQuery platform can analyze and determine user behavior, intercept high-risk user operations, issue alerts, and create a user profile of data operations. For database actions, CloudQuery conducts real-time monitoring during operations and comprehensive post-operation auditing. The audit content covers system management and security behavior, retaining logs and records.

Therefore, the core technology of database security products lies in accurately parsing SQL and identifying, analyzing, intercepting, and alerting on high-risk and unauthorized behaviors.</p><p>Traditional security vendors use a database protocol parsing approach based on network traffic monitoring, which is prone to issues such as inaccurate or lost data. Additionally, this approach, relying on database protocol analysis and cracking, cannot cover new versions of databases and requires high precision in database protocol analysis. It generates a large amount of dirty data when dealing with new versions or databases with private protocols.</p><p>In this solution, a self-developed database client approach is employed. It can accurately record and parse SQL executed by users on the platform, achieving 100% accuracy. This greatly distinguishes it from the vast amount of unusable and unreadable data generated by traditional database protocol analysis.</p><p>Furthermore, traditional data security management tools can only provide security control capabilities without improving data usage efficiency. They rely on the centralized traffic control model, which is no longer suitable for the increasingly complex multi-cloud database environment. In the wave of the era heading towards a diverse and hybrid database era, we need a unified database management platform that spans multiple clouds, databases, and endpoints.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="7-deployment">7.
